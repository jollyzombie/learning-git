            <p class="phrase">I don't want to spend the rest of my life in doubt<br>
                Don't shake me, don't wake me <br>I got a battle I aim to win now</p>

            <p class="phrase">I don't want to fall back from bowing out<br>
                Don't shame me, don't take me<br>
                Or lock me down in the walls</p>

            <p class="phrase">Where I'd dissolve<br>
                Where I don't belong</p>

            <p class="phrase">I hope you die healing the habitual<br>
                Way of a life in a body overthrown<br>
                I'll always rise far beyond the chemicals<br>
                Run through the veins and shot to the place you've grown</p>

            <p class="phrase">So take your pity and go, I won't waste my life looking back<br>
                I ain't got the time and this ain't the place<br>
                To count all the minutes that passed</p>

            <p class="phrase">I'll be hanging on whether you're still around<br>
                Or you're long gone<br>
                Don't shame me, don't take me<br>
                Or lock me down until I'm done</p>
            <p class="phrase">Where I'd dissolve<br>
                Where I don't belong</p>

            <p class="phrase">I hope you die healing the habitual<br>
                Way of a life in a body overthrown<br>
                I'll always rise far beyond the chemicals<br>
                Run through the veins, shot to the place you've grown, oh-oh</p>

            <p class="phrase">I may go but it won't mean I've gone<br>
                It won't mean I've lost<br>
                I won't cave, I won't cave<br>
                I won't cave, I won't cave<br>
                I won't cave, I won't cave<br>
                I won't cave, I'm wide awake<br>
                I'm not afraid, I'm wide awake</p>

            <p class="phrase">I don't want to spend the rest of my life in doubt<br>
                Don't shake me, don't wake me<br>
                I got a battle to win</p>

            <p class="phrase">
                <span>I hope you die healing the habitual</span><br>
                Way of a life in a body overthrown<br>
                I'll always rise far beyond the chemicals<br>
                Run through the veins and shot to the place you've grown</p>
